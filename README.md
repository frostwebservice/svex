## About Social Vex

Social Vex is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Social Vex takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://Social Vex.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://Social Vex.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://Social Vex.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://Social Vex.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://Social Vex.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://Social Vex.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://Social Vex.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://Social Vex.com/docs/broadcasting).

Social Vex is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
